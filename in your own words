What is scope? Your explanation should include the idea of global vs. local scope.

Scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in your code. For code using let and cont, 
the two types of scopes to understand are global vs. local scope. When a variable is called in global scope, it can be used anywhere. 
Simply put, any variable not in a function is in global scope. On the other hand, a block scope is a variable defined in a function. 
Block scope means that the variable defined in the function is only accessible within the function. 

Why are global variables avoided?

Global varibles are avoided because they can create side effects. The combination of global variables and side effects will lead to 
the code becoming indeterminate. An indeterminate function is a function that when given a set of inputs, returns one value sometimes
and another the other times. 

Explain JavaScript's strict mode

Javascript's strict mode is when anytime a variable is declared without let or const, an error will show up. 

What are side effects, and what is a pure function?
A side effect is when a function alters something outside of its domain. This leads to an indeterminate function. On the other hand,
a pure function is when it is both determinate and has no side effects.
